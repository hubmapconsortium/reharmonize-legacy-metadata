Name,Description,Example
acquisition_instrument_model,Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.,
acquisition_instrument_vendor,An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.,
analyte_class,,
antibodies_path,Relative path to file with antibody information for this dataset.,
assay_category,,
assay_type,,
contributors_path,Relative path to file with ORCID IDs for contributors for this dataset.,
data_path,Relative path to file or directory with instrument data. Downstream processing will depend on filename extension conventions.,
description,Free-text description of this assay.,
donor_id,HuBMAP Display ID of the donor of the assayed tissue.,ABC123
execution_datetime,"Start date and time of assay, typically a date-time stamped folder generated by the acquisition instrument. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month with leading 0s, and DD is the day with leading 0s, hh is the hour with leading zeros, mm are the minutes with leading zeros.",
is_targeted,Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay.,
number_of_antibodies,Number of antibodies,
number_of_channels,Number of fluorescent channels imaged during each cycle.,
number_of_cycles,"Number of cycles of 1. oligo application, 2. fluor application, 3. washes",
operator,Name of the person responsible for executing the assay.,
operator_email,Email address for the operator.,
pi,Name of the principal investigator responsible for the data.,
pi_email,Email address for the principal investigator.,
preparation_instrument_model,The model number/name of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay,
preparation_instrument_vendor,The manufacturer of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay.,
protocols_io_doi,DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay.,
reagent_prep_protocols_io_doi,DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing reagents for the assay.,
resolution_x_unit,The unit of measurement of width of a pixel.(nm),
resolution_x_value,The width of a pixel. (Akoya pixel is 377nm square),
resolution_y_unit,The unit of measurement of height of a pixel. (nm),
resolution_y_value,The height of a pixel. (Akoya pixel is 377nm square),
resolution_z_unit,The unit of incremental distance between image slices.,
resolution_z_value,"Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.",
section_prep_protocols_io_doi,DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing tissue sections for the assay.,
tissue_id,HuBMAP Display ID of the assayed tissue.,ABC123-BL-1-2-3_456
version,Version of the schema to use when validating this metadata.,
