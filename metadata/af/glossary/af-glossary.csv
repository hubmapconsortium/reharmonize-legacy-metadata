Name,Description,Example
acquisition_instrument_model,Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.,
acquisition_instrument_vendor,An acquisition instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing the molecular mass.,
analyte_class,,
assay_category,,
assay_type,,
contributors_path,Relative path to file with ORCID IDs for contributors for this dataset.,
data_path,Relative path to file or directory with instrument data. Downstream processing will depend on filename extension conventions.,
description,Free-text description of this assay.,
donor_id,HuBMAP Display ID of the donor of the assayed tissue.,ABC123
execution_datetime,"Start date and time of assay, typically a date-time stamped folder generated by the acquisition instrument. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month with leading 0s, and DD is the day with leading 0s, hh is the hour with leading zeros, mm are the minutes with leading zeros.",
is_targeted,Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay.,
number_of_channels,Number of channels capturing the emission spectrum from natural fluorophores in the sample.,
operator,Name of the person responsible for executing the assay.,
operator_email,Email address for the operator.,
overall_protocols_io_doi,DOI for protocols.io referring to the overall protocol for the assay.,
pi,Name of the principal investigator responsible for the data.,
pi_email,Email address for the principal investigator.,
protocols_io_doi,DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay.,
resolution_x_unit,The unit of measurement of the width of a pixel.,
resolution_x_value,The width of a pixel.,
resolution_y_unit,The unit of measurement of the height of a pixel.,
resolution_y_value,The height of a pixel,
resolution_z_unit,The unit of incremental distance between image slices.,
resolution_z_value,"Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices, ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments to capture images of several focal planes.",
tissue_id,HuBMAP Display ID of the assayed tissue.,ABC123-BL-1-2-3_456
version,Version of the schema to use when validating this metadata.,
